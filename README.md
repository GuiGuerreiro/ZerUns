My Algorithm and Data Structure project for my MEEC course, which i developed with my collegue

The objective of this project is for our algorithm to solve a binary sudoku, reading the puzzles
from the file and then writing a new file with the solution for each puzzle and indicating for the
unsolvable ones that they cannot be solved.
This version passed all the tests done be the teachers in the given limits of memory(100MB) and time(60 seconds).
